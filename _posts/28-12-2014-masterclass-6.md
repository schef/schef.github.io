I'm seek and weak. So today maybe less information.

### Keywords

The little experiance of joy or happynes as an experiance of the depth of perception which music has to offer.

### Exercise
###### Unlocking tehnique with major and minor secodns.

We go deeper into our color tehnique exercisses. Right now were getting our ear to zoom in on our tones to unlock them. So that were able to hear each tone discretly. Now were gana make it a little trickier. Were ganna do the same things with major and minor seconds.

*Solo keyboards*

1. Major and minor seconds (harmonicly, only white tones). And were singing it from the bottom up (melodicly).
A little bit of an ear teaser for you to sort out the top tone from the bottom tone. As you continue they clearify. When you can sing it then your ear has open up that much more.
2. Unlock any two tones using one hand only (octave) and sing them from the bottom up.
3. Unlock wide tones. This means we play our tones wide. We reach out with two hands and play tones that are more spaced out ( bigger then one octave ) and we sing them from the bottom up. The octave is not important. Were listening them in whatever the octave they are and were singing them in what ever range voice we can sing them

###### Last unlocking solo drills.

4. Do three tones close. Reach out play any three tones one handed. We listen , we unlock the sounds with our ears so we here each note discretly and then we sing them from the bottom up. And we check ourselfs.
5. Three tones wide. Reach out, play two tones in one hand and one tone in the other hand.

Remember, go slow on this drills. We listen with great intrest. Remember, its the listening that is opening our ear. So evan if we can do this drill easily we still need to take time to listen. This is the key to development of perfect pitch. If you for example can't hear the middle tone in drill 4. Listen again, and play separatly. And then play the problem chord again. Allow you ear to relax. Don't strain or force you ear in any way.
Any time you find that a chord is trickie it just go to proof that you ear was not hearing thise things all along. The ear was sleeping. It just shows we need ear traning. Keep working on our ear and youl find that it will cooperate and it will begin to hear this things. The magic formula is: keep listening, keep listening, keep listening and listen gently.

###### Meditation tehnique for this session

*All instrumentalist*

We play a tone, we think of it, and we sing it again.
We think the tone before we sing it. This is the diference.
We always correct our mistakes. We never just move on. We always take the time to hear the wrong note and the right note.
Do it like a meditation. Slow, queit, easy and relaxed.

*Solo guitar*

The same as solo keyboards.


We'll considure to have pass that drill when we can do one verification round.
A verification round means that you pass tweny examples in a row all corectly without a mistake.
If you didn't do it right you have to correct your error. If you make a mistake you have to go all over again. When you do one verification round then you have masterd this drill.

15 minutes a day on the solo drills until your confortable with them.

*Team drills*

Melodic and Harmonic pitch indentification. C and D exacept guitarist. Guitarist A and B(H).
1. One person plays evan C or D and the other person names it. One verification round.
2. Were ganna play two tones together. We indetify from the bottom up. Close or wide. When we play melodicly we always indentifie in the order that they were played.
Don't skip a drill if you think that they are easy.
