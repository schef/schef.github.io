*Solo keyboard*

**8-1** Acending melodic thirds pitch indetification drill. OVR.
**8-2** Decending melodic thirds pitch indetification drill. OVR.
**8-3** Harmonic thirds pitch indetification drill. OVR.

Were not singing the tone. We only identify them.
If you have problem with harmonic thirds. You can start with loose harmonic thirds. You can baby your ear if you need some help. Up and forth.

Remember. Go slowly. Don't listen to fast. Were not doing speed recignitions of tones. Like on the relative pitch course. Later yes. But now is not the time. Let your ear soak in as you listen.

*Solo guitar*
...

*Ear traning meditation*

**8-4** C, D, E and F. OVR.
Chose one tone at random. For example E. This up what an E sounds like in you mind. Then sing the tone. Maybe youll get the first tone wrong. But once you know the first tone you kinda get oriented so next tone will be alot easyer. Don't worry if you get the first tone wrong.

*Team players.*

C, D, E and F.
**8-5** Melodic single. OVR.
**8-6** Melodic double. OVR.
**8-7** Harmonic double. OVR.

Something is happening underneath the surface. Right now your using mainly relative pitch.
