When you can identify tones at a minor third your certenly going to be able to identify tones at a minor second.
There is no feeling of home base. And when you listen to this you can get dizzy doing it. Dont spend too long.

When you can do this quite well then do the speed recognition of tones with the same drill.
That means your partner play tones at an evan rate pretty fast (35bpm).
If you know say the anwser if you don't just let that note slip by.
You can do that on any pitch indentification drill.
The speed recognition drill will gear up your ear to hear rapidly.
It's a very good drill to do. And so that you don't get to dizzy i want you to spend some time with alternate pitch singing using your full C major scale and As.
Hear what you can hear and be happy about it.
