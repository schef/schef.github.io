I'm a Double bass player. Now I remembered that I couldn't decide on which instrument to practice the exercises. He says that you should be on your live, own instrument but on the other hand that people with no musical experience can both learn perfect pitch. I'm a `python` programming hobbyist and I will try to write all the practices. 

### Keywords
Relative and perfect pitch are both important.
Relative pitch help us to say that the chord is *dominant:9* and perfect pitch is helping us to hear that it is on tone **d**.
Absolute means non changing. **A** has always the same sound. It is absolute.

Different levels:

- color awareness
- color discrimination (12 chromatic pitch colors) - quality of sound

### Exercise

Go to your own instrument and have a listen, here for yourself that this color sounds do exist.
