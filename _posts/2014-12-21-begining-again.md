This is a third time that I'll try to develop perfect pitch. My first approach was at the freshmen year at the university at Zagreb. I did David Lucas Burge program and I did develop until then but didn't develop perfect pitch as it was proposed. Now I will try to find time to really practice the program and in detail to document what I am going through. I remember that the practice lessons where really hard and I needed more time than it was suggested in the program.
