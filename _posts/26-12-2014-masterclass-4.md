Q&A
Listen if your are interested.

### Exercise

1. Be creative and be a child for a while. Listen to all chromatic tones on your instrument. From c to c and try to find a color which best matches what you feel then draw it. Colored notes or rainbow. We don't wanna miss the start. Draw your own color chart.
(Do the practice. It allows you to listen to the sounds creatively.)
