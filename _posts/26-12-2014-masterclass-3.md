About the tones. I didn't hear color as he said but I started to hear tones in space. I'm aware now that each tone has its own place in space.

p.s. don't force yourself.

### Keywords

We learn to distinguish these colors between the very fine variations that there are the tones.
But they become very clear. We get to know this sound colors.
We have to get it out of that habit (listening horizontally) and into the habit of listening inside the tones.
Composers have used variates keys and chords in different ways for different reasons even unconsciously.
Absolute pitch training is a effortless training. What we don't wanna do is practice perfect pitch training with this idea that your gonna get in there and force your ear and wipe it and shape. If you strain the ear will not hear. Ear will only feel when it feels comfortable and relaxed and you just let it listen.
As we do listen our color discrimination grows.

-3. level of perfect pitch: Refined color discrimination (you can tell if tone is sharp or flat to standard concert pitch)

Some people think if you have perfect pitch that you have mental barometer in your brain witch just register *BOING* and tells you exactly how high or low the pitch is. 

Firstly you can here this colors on your own instrument, but as soon as somebody plays it on some other instrument we have no idea, your completely lost. Now this is a common experience. This is perfect pitch but it's just one level of it. We can refine our hearing even more so that we can here it on all instruments. This would be called **Universal color discrimination**. When the ear can here this colors clearly and recognized them in all the universal variety of pitches whether is our own instrument on piano, guitar, oboe, violin, bassoon, bells, little glasses of water, whistle or birds, voices.
The ear has to learn the distinction between pitch colors (pitch itself) and tone color (of the instrument). Spectral discrimination.
It's a human perception.

-4. level: aural recall (not raw memorising, it's hearing a color)

When you want to sing Ab you don't judge how high or low the tone is. What you do you think up is the color sound. What does it sounds like.

### Exercise

1. Try F# ( 1 3 5 8 ) and Eb chords and listen to the difference. Were are not listening to a clear difference, it's a saddle thing. It's a feeling that when you play the F# chord and you move to the Eb something has changed.

2. Listen a little more for yourself.

3. Read you perfect pitch handbook.

4. Another listen to the tones. Listen gently and easily to the tones.
