    <p>I&#39;m an Double bass player. Now I remembered that I couldn&#39;t decide on which instrument to practice the exercises. He says that they should be on your live own instrument but on the other hand that people with no musical experience can both learn perfect pitch. I&#39;m a <code>python</code> programming hobbyist and I will try to write all the practices. </p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>Relative and perfect pitch are both important.
Relative pitch help us to say that the chord is <em>dominant:9</em> and perfect pitch is helping us to hear that it is on tone <strong>d</strong>.
Absolute means non changing. <strong>A</strong> has always the same sound. It is absolute.</p>

<p>Different levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>color awareness</li>
<li>color discrimination (12 chromatic pitch colors) - quality of sound</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Go to your own instrument and have a listen, here for yourself that this color sounds do exist.</p>

    <p>Perfect pitch sounds so long good until you take your pace to practice it. It&#39;s always hard to learn something new. It takes time and energy.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t buy the program. I found it on <a href="http://www.grooveshark.com">GrooveShark</a> website. Here is a little <img src="http://schef.github.io/assets/dlb-pp.jpg" alt="image"> of the supercourse.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>Performer can only preform as well as he can here.
A composer can only compose what he can think up.
And you can only think up what your ear can comprehend, what your ear can grasp.
You can only appreciate and enjoy whatever your own perception and awareness allows you to enjoy.
It is all dependent on your own musical awareness.
Perfect pitch is the color in music (black and white TV example.
Its a delicate perception which opens up the ear in all area of music.
Its something which is already in our ear.</p>

    <p>This is a third time that I&#39;ll try to develop perfect pitch. My first approach was at the freshmen year at the university at Zagreb. I did David Lucas Burge program and I did develop until then but didn&#39;t develop perfect pitch as it was proposed. Now I will try to find time to really practice the program and in detail to document what I am going through. I remember that the practice lessons where really hard and I needed more time than it was suggested in the program.</p>

    <p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown">the project&#39;s readme</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.</p>
